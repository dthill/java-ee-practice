# E-commerce - Add product
Based on the previous implementation, the app provides a form to add a new product with a product name and price to the existing table of products listed underneath.
The Product ID is autogenerated by incrementing the last ID in the table.
On form submission the contents of the form is validated. The name cannot be an empty string and the price needs to be a valid positive double value. If the user submits invalid data he is informed by a message shown to him informing him why the product was not added. If the data is valid and the product is added then the user sees a success message and his product will appear in the list of all products under the form.

Hibernate was used to implement the persistence layer of the app and the product list/search feature was also updated to use hibernate.
